Tools: Figma, Canva, SQL (Concept), AI Model (Concept)

🧩 1. Problem Statement

In a world driven by technology, electronic waste (e-waste) has quietly become one of the fastest-growing environmental threats. Old phones, batteries, and laptops often end up in landfills or forgotten drawers, releasing harmful toxins and wasting reusable materials.

Despite growing awareness, there’s no easy, transparent, or rewarding way for individuals to dispose of e-waste responsibly. Users find recycling inconvenient, recyclers lack streamlined systems, and governments struggle to track waste flow.

💡 2. The Idea – EcoDrop

EcoDrop was born from a simple observation: people are willing to recycle if the process is convenient and rewarding.

The goal was to design a platform that combines AI, design, and sustainability to make e-waste management effortless, transparent, and engaging for everyone — from households to recyclers.

⚙️ 3. Core Features

User Registration & Profiles – Separate modules for consumers and recyclers.

E-Waste Collection Requests – Schedule a pickup or find the nearest drop-off point.

AI-Powered Categorization – Upload or scan items; the system auto-detects and classifies waste type for efficient recycling.

Reward System – Earn eco-points for every responsible action, redeemable for vouchers or donations.

Role-Based Dashboards –

Users: Track requests and rewards.

Recyclers: Manage collections and logistics.

Admins: Monitor operations and sustainability metrics.

🎨 4. Design Approach

EcoDrop’s design philosophy blends functionality with empathy — making sustainability approachable rather than intimidating.

🚀 6. Impact

EcoDrop redefines e-waste management as a user-centered, tech-driven, and community-led experience.
It not only simplifies recycling but also instills a sense of responsibility — proving that small digital actions can drive large environmental changes.

Potential Outcomes:

🧠 7. Reflection

Designing EcoDrop taught me that sustainability starts with usability.
When eco-friendly actions are made effortless and rewarding, people don’t just participate — they commit.
This project strengthened my ability to think across user psychology, system design, and environmental ethics, while ensuring that technology serves both people and the planet.
